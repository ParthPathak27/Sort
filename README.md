# Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort &amp; Quick Sort
This code helps you to understand the different Sorting algorithms. The sorting algorithms depicted in this code are:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort

### Code Requirements
The example code is in Java ([version 1.8](https://java.com/en/download/) or higher will work).

### Description
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input, performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array. Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists; it is also often useful for canonicalizing data and for producing human-readable output. More formally, the output must satisfy two conditions:
```
The output is in nondecreasing order.
The output is a permutation (reordering) of the input.
```
